# AgriCraft Mob Drop Crops
[Pam's Mob Drop Crops](http://mods.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/221919-pams-mob-drop-crops) adds crops for vanilla (hostile) mob drops. It is intended for playing on peaceful or in similar situations/packs. Unfortunately the crops are not inherently compatible with  [AgriCraft](http://mods.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/225635-agricraft).

This mod supplies a small compatibility layer that makes the crops plantable on AgriCraft crop sticks, including stat upgrades etc. No default mutations are provided, those have to be added manually via AgriCraft config or MineTweaker if desired.

The AgriCraft tier of the seeds is configurable, as well as whether the crops accept bonemeal or not (the bone crop can be configured separately from the others in this regard).
